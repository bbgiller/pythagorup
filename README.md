## Background
**Pythagorup** is a game designed to give students practice with basic geometry/trigonometry. Different shapes fall from the top of the screen (e.g. triangle, rectangle, rhombus, pentagon. When the shape first falls on the top of the screen, you are presented with information about the shape, such as data about its length or width. You then have to solve the missing information (e.g. length, width, height, hypotenuse, volume, Î¸). Upon successfully solving for the information, the shape will break and disappear. If the solution is not entered in time, the shape will stack on top of the shape that had fallen below it. The player may still enter in the answer to the question to the shape and it will break, but they also must focus on the falling shape. Bonus shapes with harder problems to solve will occasionally appear, and upon solution, will break all shapes on the screen. If the shapes pile up and hit the top of the screen, the player will lose the game.

## MVPs & Functionality
1. Start, pause, and reset game
2. Shapes fall and trigger end of game when piled up to top, and win after solving a predetermined amount of shapes
3. Shapes are randomly assigned attributes and math randomly from prepopulated functions generated with correct solutions
4. Animations that show breaking shape/explosion on board for bonus
5. Modal that describes game rules and instructions
6. A production README
